# Odin Recipes

## Introduction

This is my first HTML project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).  
I built a basic recipe website using only HTML.

The website has:

- A main page with links to recipes
- Separate pages for each recipe
- Each recipe page has a description, list of ingredients, and steps

## What I Learned

- How to write basic HTML
- How to create multiple pages and link them together
- How to use headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images
- How to use Git and GitHub to save and share my code


## Project Status

Finished basic structure  
Will add styles later using CSS in a future lesson
